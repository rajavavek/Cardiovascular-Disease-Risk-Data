This dataset contains information on the biochemical markers used to assess cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in urban and rural populations in Pakistan. The study compares the role of biochemical markers in assessing CVD risk factors between these two populations, with a focus on total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and fasting blood glucose levels. Additionally, demographic and lifestyle factors such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary habits are included.

The dataset was collected from a cross-sectional study with 120 participants, including 60 from urban areas and 60 from rural areas. The study aims to highlight the impact of urbanization on cardiovascular risk.

## Dataset Details

- **Total Samples**: 120 participants (60 urban, 60 rural)
- **Age Range**: 30-65 years
- **Variables Included**:
  - **Demographics**:
    - Gender
    - Age
    - Physical Activity Level (Sedentary, Moderate, Active)
    - Smoking Status (Yes/No)
    - Alcohol Consumption (Days per Week)
    - Processed Food Intake (Yes/No)
  - **Biochemical Markers**:
    - Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)
    - Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL, mg/dL)
    - High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL, mg/dL)
    - Triglycerides (TG, mg/dL)
    - High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP, mg/L)
    - Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG, mg/dL)

## Objective of the Study

The study aimed to compare the cardiovascular risk profiles of urban and rural populations in Pakistan, focusing on the differences in biochemical markers and lifestyle factors. The results highlight the adverse effects of urbanization on metabolic health and emphasize the need for targeted public health interventions in urban areas to reduce cardiovascular disease risks.

## Usage

You can use this dataset for research related to cardiovascular health, urbanization's impact on metabolic health, and the role of biochemical markers in assessing cardiovascular risk. The dataset can also be useful for studies comparing urban and rural health disparities, lifestyle influences, and the effectiveness of public health policies.
